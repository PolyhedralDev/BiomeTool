Biome Tool is a creatively named utility for developing biome
configurations for Terra

This is a simple dummy platform implementation that provides
mock objects to the platform, focusing only on loading biomes.


It should work with most Terra addons, it's been tested extensively
and verified to work with the core addons.

## Usage
Download the tool to a separate directory. Install addons to an `addons`
folder, install config packs to a `packs` folder. Run the tool from the
command line to view log output.

Use Java 17
